NAME
    isoc_ams - Extract or modify Chapter Data of the ISOC AMS (Salesforce) Database.

DESCRIPTION
    DESCRIPTION
    
        This module consists of a Class ISOC_AMS wrapping _ISOC_AMS which subclasses
        the webdriver.<browser> of Selenium. Up to now ownly firefox and chrome
        drivers are implemented and tested.
    
    CLASS
        PROPERTIES
            The ISOC_AMS class provides the following properties:
                members_list:
                    a list of Chapter members (according to AMS) with data (and links)
                pending_applicants_list:
                    a list of pending appplicants  (according to AMS) for a Chapter
                    membership with data (and links)
            these properties are initialized after login ... and this will take time
    
        METHODS
            The ISOC_AMS class provides the following methods:
                build_members_list:
                    to build a list of Chapter members with data (and links)
                build_pending_applicants_list:
                    to build a list of pending appplicants for a Chapter membership with
                    data (and links)
                deny_applicants:
                    to deny Chapter membership for a list of applicants
                approve_applicants:
                    to approve Chapter membership for a list of applicants
                delete_members:
                    to revoke Chapter membership for members from the members list
                difference_from_expected:
                    to reread AMS and check if all operations were successfull (not ever
                    problem can be detected by the methods)
    
        ISOC_AMS will log you in to ISOC.ORG and check your authorization at
        instantiation.
    
        To select a webdriver, an ISOC_AMS_WEBDRIVER environment variable can be used.
        E.g.
            ISOC_AMS_WEBDRIVER=Firefox
    
        Default is Firefox. Only Firefox and Chrome are allowed for now.
    
    FUNCTIONS
        3 functions are provided to support logging:
            log, dlog, strong_message
        (see below)
    
    EXAMPLE
    
            from isoc_ams import ISOC_AMS
            userid, password = "myuserid", "mysecret"
    
            # this will log you in
            # and instantiate an ISOC_AMS object
            ams = ISOC_AMS(userid, password)
    
            # this will read the list of members,
            # registered as chapters members
            members = ams.members_list
    
            # print the results
            for isoc_id, member in members.items():
                print(isoc_id,
                      member["first name"],
                      member["last name"],
                      member["email"],
                     )
            # select members to be deleted
            deletees = <...>  # various formats are allowed for operation methods
            delete_members(deletees)
    
            # check if all went well
            difference_from_expected()
